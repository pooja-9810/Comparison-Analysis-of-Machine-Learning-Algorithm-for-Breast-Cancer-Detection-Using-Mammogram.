# Comparison-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithm-for-Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Mammogram.


Breast cancer is a significant cause of death amongst women. Basic techniques of
image processing and labeling were used to classify and diagnose breast cancer.
However, the condition is one of the most lethal, because one in six people are
diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. The cause of breast cancer
remained elusive. Prevention remains impossible. And the only way to treat
breast cancer is early detection of the breast tumor. Mammograms image
processing is the most efficient and quickest way to detect breast cancer. Early
signs of possible breast cancer are critical for the detection of breast cancer in
their infancy, including masses and clusters of micro calcification. Machine
learning is also used only with scientific purposes to clearly identify cancer cells.
Cancer cells are categorized as Benign (B) or Malignant (M) cells. Our research
aims to create a tool for identifying abnormalities in the early stage of
mammogram cancer. Here the features will be extracted in the form of data
values from the mammographic images. Finally, by using the machine learning
algorithm, all extracted collection of data values are labeled whether they are
normal or abnormal.
